Shell Basics Tasks. From 0 - 18 are scripts and must start with a Shebang. After a script is created using vi or emacs, we give the system permission to read the script by writing chmod 755 FileName, afterwards write chmod u+x FileName. We do this just before writing git add , committing and pushing.
